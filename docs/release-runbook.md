# Desktop release runbook

## Manual workflow dispatch

The `Release desktop installers` workflow accepts a `mode` on `workflow_dispatch`. `target` is always honored: `macos` does not start Windows jobs, and `windows` does not start macOS jobs.

- `development` (default): unsigned Dev packages, no signing, no publish.
- `signed`: production-identity signed packages only. Fill `signed_version` with a non-`v` semver such as `0.9.2-test.1`. Artifacts stay on the workflow run; GitHub Release, ModelScope, rollout, and Feishu do not run. These builds use the production app id and update feed, so an installed copy may later see the live `latest` channel.
- `smoke`: recheck an existing `windows-x64` signed artifact without rebuilding or signing. Set `target=windows` and `smoke_run_id` to the source release workflow run ID. The Windows runner installs that exact artifact using the current branch's smoke script.
- `resign`: sign an existing `windows-x64-unsigned` artifact without rerunning the Windows build. Set `target=windows`, `unsigned_run_id` to its source release run, and `signed_version` to the exact version used for that artifact. The self-hosted signer downloads it directly and the final signed Windows installer still runs the installation smoke.
- `prerelease`: production-identity signed packages. Fill `prerelease_tag` with a non-`v` semver such as `2.1.0-rc.1`. Publish to GitHub `--prerelease` and ModelScope `releases/prerelease/` only when `target` is `all`. A single-platform prerelease signs that platform and skips publish.

Official releases are still created by pushing a `v*` tag, not by filling the dispatch form. Do not put `v0.9.1` in `prerelease_tag` or `signed_version`.

## Build layout and timing

macOS uses one matrix job with native Apple Silicon and Intel runners. Both entries retain the same signing, notarization and artifact verification gates; publishing waits for the whole matrix. Each native job builds once (including PPT previews), runs Vitest against that prepared runtime, and packages the same output with an explicit native-target check. Windows also runs recovery UI checks before packaging. Local `npm test` and `package:*` commands still prepare their own inputs. Already compressed installer artifacts use `compression-level: 0` during upload to avoid redundant compression. Compare job step durations on the same target before changing installer compression or dependency contents.

Concurrency is grouped by ref and target: a Windows-only retry can run while an all-platform run finishes macOS notarization. Runs for the same ref and target remain serialized; publication still requires `target=all` (or a release tag), and the single local UKey runner serializes Windows signing.

The self-hosted signer downloads artifacts in six concurrent 32 MiB ranges through `gh`, retries bounded requests, and checks the complete archive against GitHub's SHA-256 digest before extraction. A real 668,014,109-byte signing artifact downloaded and verified in 149 seconds on the signing host; the previous single stream was still incomplete after ten minutes. Throughput depends on the network. A short response, failed transfer or digest mismatch leaves an existing verified output untouched and removes temporary parts.

PPT packages are generated under `.build/ppt-runtime/packages/` and overlaid into the Electron package. The `afterPack` gate checks the physical `dsh-ppt` and `dsh-ppt-composer` directories, including native imports and template previews. A successful source build alone does not verify the packaged paths.

## Local Windows UKey signing runner

Windows packaging and signing run as separate jobs. The GitHub-hosted Windows runner builds an unsigned NSIS installer and uploads a short-lived workflow artifact. A local macOS ARM64 runner downloads it, scans every PE by content, preserves existing vendor signatures, and signs unsigned PEs with Jsign and the SafeNet UKey. It signs the NSIS extraction helper and generated uninstaller during repackaging, then signs the final installer, regenerates the blockmap and `latest.yml`, and uploads the signed release set. Any missing archive, invalid PE, signing failure or repackaging failure stops the run. A second Windows runner installs the final signed artifact into isolated directories, verifies every PE signature and Harness startup, repeats the same-path installation, and checks that Profile data survives. GitHub publication requires both signing and that installed-artifact smoke to pass.

The pinned Windows NSIS template stages the application in a sibling directory before closing the old app, then renames the old directory to a backup and promotes the staged directory. A failed extraction or rename restores the previous installation. The signed installer smoke also locks the old executable to verify that a failed upgrade leaves it runnable. A user-selected different directory is an independent installation: the installer does not automatically uninstall the previous directory, which remains available until the user removes it. Keep the user-selected installation directory when changing this template; the build adapter rejects unexpected upstream template changes.

Runtime dependencies are unpacked beside `app.asar` because Harness, pnpm, native addons, and the standalone Windows Node process need physical paths. The macOS ARM64 test package contains a 6.2 MB `app.asar` and about 588 MB of unpacked dependencies; enabling asar alone did not reduce its 256 MB DMG. Do not remove `node.exe` from Windows yet: the pinned `node-addon-require-builtin@0.1.6` rejects Electron 43.4.0 in RunAsNode mode during Harness boot, even though the Koffi native probe passes ([Windows CI evidence](https://github.com/dataelement/dsh-desktop/actions/runs/35972303467)). Repeat the packaged Windows Harness and final signed-installer gates after a loader version explicitly supports the target Electron fingerprint before revisiting that removal.

Prepare the local runner once:

1. Register it with the `self-hosted`, `macOS`, and `ARM64` labels.
2. Install SafeNet Authentication Client and confirm `/usr/local/lib/libeTPkcs11.dylib` is readable.
3. Connect the UKey before pushing a release tag.
4. In the GitHub repository, open **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** and create a repository secret named `DESKTOP_WINDOWS_SIGNING_PIN` containing the UKey PIN. For stronger release controls, use an environment secret and add the matching `environment` to the `sign-windows` job.
5. Restrict release tag creation and workflow changes to trusted maintainers. A self-hosted runner can access any secret injected into its job.

The workflow pins Jsign 7.5 by SHA-256 and uses the SafeNet `ETOKEN` store, SHA-256 signing, and a DigiCert RFC 3161 timestamp. GitHub injects the PIN only into the signing step. The step copies it to a mode-`600` temporary file, removes it from the shell environment, and deletes the file when the step exits. The workflow never prints the PIN or passes it as a command-line argument.

The configured update publisher is `Beijing Shuju Xiangsu Intelligence Technology Co., Ltd.`, taken from the signed v0.9.2 installer. If the signing certificate changes, update `build.win.signtoolOptions.publisherName` only after checking the new certificate subject and the updater's signature verification on an installed Windows build. After a tag release succeeds, verify that the Windows installer shows the expected publisher and a valid RFC 3161 timestamp in its Digital Signatures properties. Never reuse a published tag; fix the issue and release a new version.
